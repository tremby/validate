NAME

Validate

SUMMARY

A commandline QTI validator.

SOURCE

The source is available at <http://github.com/tremby/validate>.

REQUIREMENTS

-	Jars for SLF4J and JQTI (see README file in the lib subdirectory)
-	Java and a Java compiler (tested on Sun Java 1.6.0)

COMPILATION

On a unix-like environment it should be possible to just run the provided 
make.sh script, which just sources the classpath.sh script (which sets up the 
class path to include all jar files in the lib subdirectory) and then invokes 
the Java compiler.

It's a trivial compilation -- I'm sure it's also very easy to compile in a 
Windows environment.

USAGE

It takes QTI XML either as standard input or via a filename given as an 
argument, for example:

./run.sh testqti.xml
or
perl getrandomquestion.pl | ./run.sh

These examples use the provided wrapper script run.sh, which sources 
classpath.sh just as the make script does and invokes Java. On other 
environments a similarly simple invocation should be possible.

OUTPUT

The validator outputs any errors, warnings or messages regarding the XML or QTI 
one per line on standard output.

The format used is message type, then the message itself, then the position or 
node in the XML, separated by tab characters, such as:

Error	The element type "reesponseDeclaration" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</reesponseDeclaration>".	7:5
or
Error	Not enough children: value. Expected at least: 1, but found: 0	assessmentItem:mcr_ce58cd5cc10e12447135d33aa890cbd3->responseDeclaration:RESPONSE->correctResponse

Any operational errors such as being unable to read the file or bogus arguments 
cause messages to be written to standard error.

EXIT CODES

0	Valid QTI, but may still have warnings or messages
1	Valid XML but not valid QTI
2	File not found
3	Error reading file
4	XML parsing error
5	Error reading from standard input
253	Validate.class not found (only used by run.sh script)
254	Unknown QTI parsing error
255	Unexpected arguments
